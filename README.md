Axis Flip is a fast-paced parkour adventure set inside a mysterious snow globe.
You play as Axi, a humble worker whose peaceful world is suddenly turned upside down — literally.

When a strange force flips the very fabric of reality, Axi must leap, climb, and wall-run through a topsy-turvy landscape to survive. But restoring balance won’t be easy… a powerful boss stands in the way, and the only path forward is through skillful parkour, clever navigation, and quick reflexes.

Created in just a short burst of creativity for Literally Anything Game Jam 3, Axis Flip is a blend of gravity-bending platforming, dynamic level design, and intense boss encounters — all wrapped inside the enchanting, snow-filled walls of a globe.

Can you help Axi turn his world right-side up?
